# Can Deep Learning Models Acquire Specialist Knowledge? Identifying Carotid Bruits in Type 2 Diabetes Using an Electronic Stethoscope
## Published in IEEE ACCESS

## Overview
This GitHub repository was established to present the results of our exploration on the potential of artificial intelligence as a substitute for trained clinician identification of a carotid bruit from multiple auditory recordings using an electronic stethoscope in 98 people with type 2 diabetes, 48 of whom had a bruit.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`notebooks/`:** Jupyter notebooks for different network architectures.
- **`datasets/Cases and controls.xlsx`:** Contains information about the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **`datasets/Cases`:** Contains the cases (positive samples) used for training and evaluation. Download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MaSoEZnNDTs8ikL4b7G0LrjzNzYbToqt?usp=sharing).
- **`datasets/Controls`:** Contains the controls (negative samples) used for training and evaluation. Download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BghQjehpiQiZ6dOpPVLce-07LduoW1rP?usp=sharing).
